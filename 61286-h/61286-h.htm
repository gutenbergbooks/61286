<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In the harbour, in the island, in the Spanish Seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are the tiny white houses and the orange-trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And day-long, night-long, the cool and pleasant breeze<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of the steady Trade Winds blowing.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There is the red wine, the nutty Spanish ale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shuffle of the dancers, the old salt’s tale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The squeaking fiddle, and the soughing in the sail<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of the steady Trade Winds blowing.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And at nights there’s fire-flies and the yellow moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the ghostly palm-trees the sleepy tune<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the quiet voice calling me, the long low croon<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of the steady Trade Winds blowing.<br /></span>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I must go down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wheel’s kick and the wind’s song and the white sail’s shaking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a grey mist on the sea’s face and a grey dawn breaking.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I must go down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all I ask is a windy day with the white clouds flying,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the flung spray and the blown spume, and the sea-gulls crying.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I must go down to the seas again to the vagrant gypsy life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the gull’s way and the whale’s way where the wind’s like a whetted knife;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all I ask is a merry yarn from a laughing fellow-rover,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quiet sleep and a sweet dream when the long trick’s over.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When the last sea is sailed and the last shallow charted,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When the last field is reaped and the last harvest stored,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the last fire is out and the last guest departed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Grant the last prayer that I shall pray, Be good to me, O Lord!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And let me pass in a night at sea, a night of storm and thunder,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In the loud crying of the wind through sail and rope and spar;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Send me a ninth great peaceful wave to drown and roll me under<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To the cold tunny-fishes’ home where the drowned galleons are.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And in the dim green quiet place far out of sight and hearing,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Grant I may hear at whiles the wash and thresh of the sea-foam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About the fine keen bows of the stately clippers steering<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Towards the lone northern star and the fair ports of home.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">It’s a warm wind, the west wind, full of birds’ cries;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I never hear the west wind but tears are in my eyes.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And April’s in the west wind, and daffodils.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It’s a fine land, the west land, for hearts as tired as mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Apple orchards blossom there, and the air’s like wine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is cool green grass there, where men may lie at rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the thrushes are in song there, fluting from the nest.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Will you not come home, brother? you have been long away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It’s April, and blossom time, and white is the spray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bright is the sun, brother, and warm is the rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will you not come home, brother, home to us again?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The young corn is green, brother, where the rabbits run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It’s blue sky, and white clouds, and warm rain and sun.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_5" id="page_5">{5}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">It’s song to a man’s soul, brother, fire to a man’s brain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hear the wild bees and see the merry spring again.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Larks are singing in the west, brother, above the green wheat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So will ye not come home, brother, and rest your tired feet?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’ve a balm for bruised hearts, brother, sleep for aching eyes,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Says the warm wind, the west wind, full of birds’ cries.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Harry, my man, when we were courting; eh ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The April morning up the Cony-gree.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How grand he looked upon our wedding day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘I wish we’d had the bells,’ he said to me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we’d the moon that evening, I and he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dew come wet, oh, I remember how,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we come home to where I’m sitting now.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he lay dead here, and his son was born here;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He never saw his son, his little Jim.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now I’m all alone here, left to mourn here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there are all his clothes, but never him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’s down under the prison in the dim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With quicklime working on him to the bone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flesh I made with many and many a groan.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And then he ran so, he was strong at running,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Always a strong one, like his dad at that.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In summertimes I done my sewing sunning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he’d be sprawling, playing with the cat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And neighbours brought their knitting out to chat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till five o’clock; he had his tea at five;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How sweet life was when Jimmy was alive.”<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Singing “The parson’s dog lep over a stile,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the path where water lilies grew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stars are placid on the evening’s blue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_21" id="page_21">{21}</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">The lamps are lighted in the village shops.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silence; the last bird passes; in the copse<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The moon droops west, but still she does not cease,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Until the inn-man’s cockerel shakes his wing.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Rubbing the sleep out of their heavy eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They lean upon the parapet to stare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They see her plaiting basil in her hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Basil, the dark red wound-wort, cops of clover,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blue self-heal and golden Jacks of Dover.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_22" id="page_22">{22}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dully they watch her, then they turn to go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To that high Shropshire upland of late hay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her singing lingers with them as they mow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many times they try it, now grave, now gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, with full throat, over the hills away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They lift it clear; oh, very clear it towers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mixed with the swish of many falling flowers.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Each failure, each derision, each mistake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There in the life not made for such as he;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A morning grim with trouble sure to be,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When the loud Horn made every life a hell?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the sick ship lay over, clanging her bell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_24" id="page_24">{24}</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">The green bunk curtains moved, the brass rings clicked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Cook cursed in his sleep, turning and turning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moonbeam’s moving finger touched and picked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the stars in all the sky were burning.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“This is the art I’ve come for, and am learning,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He leaned upon his arm and watched the light<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The space below the bunks as black as coal,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With faces ducked down from the slanting drive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of half-thawed hail mixed with half-frozen spray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The roaring canvas, like a thing alive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shaking the mast, knocking their hands away,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The insensate grey before the marvel grew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the veil lifted from the trembling blue,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Outside was the ship’s rush to the wind’s hurry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A resonant wire-hum from every rope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The broadening bow-wash in a fiery flurry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The leaning masts in their majestic slope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all things strange with moonlight: filled with hope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By all that beauty going as man bade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He turned and slept in peace. Eight bells were made.<br /></span>

<h3><a name="THE_HORN" id="THE_HORN"></a>THE HORN</h3>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Even now they shifted suits of sails; they bent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The storm-suit ready for the expected time;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mighty wester that the Plate had lent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had brought them far into the wintry clime.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At dawn, out of the shadow, there was rime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dim Magellan Clouds were frosty clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wind had edge, the testing-time was near.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And then he wondered if the tales were lies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Told by old hands to terrify the new,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, since the ship left England, only twice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had there been need to start a sheet or clew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then only royals, for an hour or two,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_27" id="page_27">{27}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no seas broke aboard, nor was it cold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What were these gales of which the stories told?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The thought went by. He had heard the Bosun tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too often, and too fiercely, not to know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That being off the Horn in June is hell:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hell of continual toil in ice and snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frostbitten hell in which the westers blow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrieking for days on end, in which the seas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gulf the starved seamen till their marrows freeze.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Such was the weather he might look to find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such was the work expected: there remained<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Firmly to set his teeth, resolve his mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And be the first, however much it pained,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bring his honour round the Horn unstained,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And win his mates’ respect; and thence, untainted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be ranked as man however much he painted.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He drew deep breath; a gantline swayed aloft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lower topsail, hard with rope and leather,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as men’s frozen fingers fight with oft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Below the Ramirez in Cape Horn weather.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The arms upon the yard hove all together,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lighting the head along; a thought occurred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the painter’s brain like a bright bird:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_28" id="page_28">{28}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That this, and so much like it, of man’s toil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Compassed by naked manhood in strange places,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was all heroic, but outside the coil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within which modern art gleams or grimaces;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That if he drew that line of sailors’ faces<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweating the sail, their passionate play and change,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It would be new, and wonderful, and strange.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That that was what his work meant; it would be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A training in new vision, a revealing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of passionate men in battle with the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High on an unseen stage, shaking and reeling;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And men through him would understand their feeling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their might, their misery, their tragic power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all by suffering pain a little hour;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">High on the yard with them, feeling their pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Battling with them; and it had not been done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was a door to new worlds in the brain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A window opening letting in the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A voice saying, “Thus is bread fetched and ports won,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And life lived out at sea where men exist<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Solely by man’s strong brain and sturdy wrist.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_29" id="page_29">{29}</a></span>”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So he decided, as he cleaned his brasses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hearing without, aloft, the curse, the shout<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the taut gantline passes and repasses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaving new topsails to be lighted out.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was most proud, however self might doubt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To share man’s tragic toil and paint it true.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He took the offered Fate: this he would do.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That night the snow fell between six and seven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little feathery fall so light, so dry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An aimless dust out of a confused heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon an air no steadier than a sigh;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The powder dusted down and wandered by<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So purposeless, so many, and so cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then died, and the wind ceased and the ship rolled.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Rolled till she clanged, rolled till the brain was tired,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marking the acme of the heaves, the pause<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the sea-beauty rested and respired,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drinking great draughts of roller at her hawse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flutters of snow came aimless upon flaws.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Lock up your paints,” the Mate said, speaking light:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“This is the Horn; you’ll join my watch to-night!”<br /></span>

<span class="i0">All through the windless night the clipper rolled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a great swell with oily gradual heaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_30" id="page_30">{30}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which rolled her down until her time-bells tolled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clang, and the weltering water moaned like beeves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thundering rattle of slatting shook the sheaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Startles of water made the swing ports gush,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sea was moaning and sighing and saying “Hush!”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It was all black and starless. Peering down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the water, trying to pierce the gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One saw a dim, smooth, oily glitter of brown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaving and dying away and leaving room<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For yet another. Like the march of doom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came those great powers of marching silences;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then fog came down, dead-cold, and hid the seas.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They set the Dauber to the foghorn. There<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stood upon the poop, making to sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the pump the sailors’ nasal blare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listening lest ice should make the note resound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She bayed there like a solitary hound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lost in a covert; all the watch she bayed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fog, come closelier down, no answer made.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Denser it grew, until the ship was lost.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The elemental hid her; she was merged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In mufflings of dark death, like a man’s ghost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New to the change of death, yet thither urged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_31" id="page_31">{31}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then from the hidden waters something surged&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mournful, despairing, great, greater than speech,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A noise like one slow wave on a still beach.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Mournful, and then again mournful, and still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the night that mighty voice arose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Dauber at his foghorn felt the thrill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who rode that desolate sea? What forms were those?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mournful, from things defeated, in the throes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of memory of some conquered hunting-ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the night of death arose the sound.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Whales!” said the mate. They stayed there all night long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Answering the horn. Out of the night they spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Defeated creatures who had suffered wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But were still noble underneath the stroke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They filled the darkness when the Dauber woke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The men came peering to the rail to hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sea sighed, and the fog rose up sheer.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So the night past, but then no morning broke&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only a something showed that night was dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sea-bird, cackling like a devil, spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fog drew away and hung like lead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like mighty cliffs it shaped, sullen and red;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_32" id="page_32">{32}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like glowering gods at watch it did appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sometimes drew away, and then drew near.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Like islands, and like chasms, and like hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But always mighty and red, gloomy and ruddy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shutting the visible sea in like a well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slow heaving in vast ripples, blank and muddy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the sun should have risen it streaked bloody.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The day was still-born; all the sea-fowl scattering<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Polar snow came down little and light,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Most multitudinous drift of dirty white<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tumbling and wavering down and covering all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Covering the sky, the sea, the clipper tall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Furring the ropes with white, casing the mast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coming on no known air, but blowing past.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And all the air seemed full of gradual moan,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The mort for gods cast out and overthrown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or for the eyeless sun plucked out and going.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slow the low gradual moan came in the snowing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Dauber felt the prelude had begun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The snowstorm fluttered by; he saw the sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_33" id="page_33">{33}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Show and pass by, gleam from one towering prison<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into another, vaster and more grim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which in dull crags of darkness had arisen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To muffle-to a final door on him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gods upon the dull crags lowered dim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pigeons chattered, quarrelling in the track.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the south-west the dimness dulled to black.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then came the cry of “Call all hands on deck!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Dauber knew its meaning; it was come:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cape Horn, that tramples beauty into wreck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crumples steel and smites the strong man dumb.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down clattered flying kites and staysails: some<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sang out in quick, high calls; the fairleads skirled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the south-west came the end of the world.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Night fell, and all night long the Dauber lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Covered upon the table; all night long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pitiless storm exulted at her prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Huddling the waters with her icy thong.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to the covered shape she did no wrong.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lay beneath the sailcloth. Bell by bell<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Blowing most pitiless cold out of clear sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wind roared all night long; and all night through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The green seas on the deck went washing by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flooding the half-deck; bitter hard it blew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But little of it all the Dauber knew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sopping bunks, the floating chests, the wet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The darkness, and the misery, and the sweat.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He was off duty. So it blew all night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the watches changed the men would come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dripping within the door to strike a light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stare upon the Dauber lying dumb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And say, “He come a cruel thump, poor chum.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, “He’d a-been a fine big man”; or, “He ...<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Or, “Damn it all, it’s what we’ve all to face!...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I knew another fellow one time ...” then<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Out on the sea, in ships, with wandering men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In many ways Death puts us into pen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The reefers came down tired and looked and slept.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Below the skylight little dribbles crept.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_35" id="page_35">{35}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Along the painted woodwork, glistening, slow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Following the roll and dripping, never fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But dripping on the quiet form below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like passing time talking to time long past.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all night long “Ai, ai!” went the wind’s blast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And creaming water swished below the pale,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At dawn they sewed him up, and at eight bells<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They bore him to the gangway, wading deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the green-clutching, white-toothed water-hells<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That flung his carriers over in their sweep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They laid an old red ensign on the heap,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Washed by the sea while the old man was praying<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Out of a borrowed prayer-book. At a sign<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The muffled figure tilted to the weighting;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It dwindled slowly down, slowly gyrating.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some craned to see; it dimmed, it disappeared;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">“Mister, shake out your reefs,” the Captain called.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Singing that desolate song of lonely lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of how a lover came in dripping bands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Green with the wet and cold, to tell his lover<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Death was in the sea, and all was over.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fair came the falling wind; a seaman said<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The clipper held her course, showing red lead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shattering the sea-tops into golden rain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The waves bowed down before her like blown grain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Onwards she thundered, on; her voyage was short,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the tier’s bells rang her into port.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Cheerly they rang her in, those beating bells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The new-come beauty stately from the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whitening the blue heave of the drowsy swells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Treading the bubbles down. With three times three<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They cheered her moving beauty in, and she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came to her berth so noble, so superb;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swayed like a queen, and answered to the curb.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_37" id="page_37">{37}</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then in the sunset’s flush they went aloft,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And beauty in the heart breaks like a flower.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Working aloft they saw the mountain tower,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And bright along the bay the lights came out.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And then the night fell dark, and all night long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pointed mountain pointed at the stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frozen, alert, austere; the eagle’s song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Screamed from her desolate screes and splintered scars.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On her intense crags where the air is sparse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stars looked down; their many golden eyes<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And in the rest-house the muleteers arose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all day long, where only the eagle goes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stones, loosened by the sun, fall; the stones falling<br /></span>

<h4>I</h4>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Between the barren pasture and the wood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is a patch of poultry-stricken grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, in old time, Ryemeadows’ Farmhouse stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And human fate brought tragic things to pass.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A spring comes bubbling up there, cold as glass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It bubbles down, crusting the leaves with lime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Babbling the self-same song that it has sung through time.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ducks gobble at the selvage of the brook,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still it slips away, the cold hill-spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Past the Ryemeadows’ lonely woodland nook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where many a stubble gray-goose preens her wing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On, by the woodland side. You hear it sing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Past the lone copse where poachers set their wires,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Past the green hill once grim with sacrificial fires.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Another water joins it; then it turns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Runs through the Ponton Wood, still turning west,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Past foxgloves, Canterbury bells, and ferns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a blackbird’s, many a thrush’s nest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cattle tread it there; then, with a zest<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_39" id="page_39">{39}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">It sparkles out, babbling its pretty chatter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through Foxholes Farm, where it gives white-faced cattle water.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Under the road it runs, and now it slips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Past the great ploughland, babbling, drop and linn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the moss’d stumps of elm trees which it lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blackberry-bramble-trails where eddies spin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, on its left, some short-grassed fields begin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Red-clayed and pleasant, which the young spring fills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the never-quiet joy of dancing daffodils.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There are three fields where daffodils are found;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grass is dotted blue-gray with their leaves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their nodding beauty shakes along the ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up to a fir-clump shutting out the eaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of an old farm where always the wind grieves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High in the fir boughs, moaning; people call<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This farm The Roughs, but some call it the Poor Maid’s Hall.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There, when the first green shoots of tender corn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Show on the plough; when the first drift of white<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stars the black branches of the spiky thorn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_40" id="page_40">{40}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And afternoons are warm and evenings light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shivering daffodils do take delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shaking beside the brook, and grass comes green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blue dog-violets come and glistening celandine.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And there the pickers come, picking for town<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those dancing daffodils; all day they pick;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hard-featured women, weather-beaten brown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or swarthy-red, the colour of old brick.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At noon they break their meats under the rick.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The smoke of all three farms lifts blue in air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As though man’s passionate mind had never suffered there.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And sometimes as they rest an old man comes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shepherd or carter, to the hedgerow-side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And looks upon their gangrel tribe, and hums,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thinks all gone to wreck since master died;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sighs over a passionate harvest-tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Death’s red sickle reaped under those hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, in the quiet fields among the daffodils.<br /></span>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The steaming river loitered like old blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On which the tugboat bearing Michael beat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Past whitened horse bones sticking in the mud.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The reed stems looked like metal in the heat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_41" id="page_41">{41}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the banks fell away, and there were neat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Red herds of sullen cattle drifting slow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fish leaped, making rings, making the dead blood flow.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wormed hard-wood piles were driv’n in the river bank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The steamer threshed alongside with sick screws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Churning the mud below her till it stank;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Big gassy butcher-bubbles burst on the ooze.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There Michael went ashore; as glad to lose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One not a native there, the Gauchos flung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His broken gear ashore, one waved, a bell was rung.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The bowfast was cast off, the screw revolved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making a bloodier bubbling; rattling rope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell to the hatch, the engine’s tune resolved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into its steadier beat of rise and slope;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The steamer went her way; and Michael’s hope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Died as she lessened; he was there alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lowing of the cattle made a gradual moan.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He thought of Mary, but the thought was dim;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That was another life, lived long before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His mind was in new worlds which altered him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The startling present left no room for more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sullen river lipped, the sky, the shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were vaster than of old, and lonely, lonely.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sky and low hills of grass and moaning cattle only.<br /></span>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Soon he was at the Foxholes, at the place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whither, from over sea, his heart had turned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Often at evening-ends in times of grace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But little outward change his eye discerned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A red rose at her bedroom window burned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just as before. Even as of old the wasps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poised at the yellow plums; the gate creaked on its hasps<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the white fantails sidled on the roof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just as before; their pink feet, even as of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Printed the frosty morning’s rime with proof.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still the zew-tallat’s thatch was green with mould;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The apples on the withered boughs were gold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men and the times were changed: “And I,” said he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Will go and not return, since she is not for me.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I’ll go, for it would be a scurvy thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To spoil her marriage, and besides, she cares<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that half-priest she married with the ring.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Small joy for me in seeing how she wears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or seeing what he takes and what she shares.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That beauty and those ways: she had such ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There in the daffodils in those old April days.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_43" id="page_43">{43}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So with an impulse of good will he turned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving that place of daffodils; the road<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was paven sharp with memories which burned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He trod them strongly under as he strode.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the Green Turning’s forge the furnace glowed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Red dithying sparks flew from the crumpled soft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fold from the fire’s heart; down clanged the hammers oft.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That was a bitter place to pass, for there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mary and he had often, often stayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To watch the horseshoe growing in the glare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was a tryst in childhood when they strayed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was a stile beside the forge; he laid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His elbows on it, leaning, looking down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The river-valley stretched with great trees turning brown.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Infinite, too, because it reached the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And distant spires arose and distant smoke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whiteness on the blue went stilly by;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only the clinking forge the stillness broke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ryemeadows brook was there; The Roughs, the oak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the White Woman walked; the black firs showed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around the Occleve homestead, Mary’s new abode.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_44" id="page_44">{44}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A long, long time he gazed at that fair place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So well remembered from of old; he sighed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I will go down and look upon her face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See her again, whatever may betide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hell is my future; I shall soon have died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I will take to hell one memory more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She shall not see nor know; I shall be gone before;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Before they turn the dogs upon me, even.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I do not mean to speak; but only see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even the devil gets a peep at heaven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One peep at her shall come to hell with me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One peep at her, no matter what may be.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He crossed the stile and hurried down the slope.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remembered trees and hedges gave a zest to hope.<br /></span>
<span class="iast">* * * *<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A low brick wall with privet shrubs beyond<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ringed in The Roughs upon the side he neared;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eastward some bramble bushes cloaked the pond;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Westward was barley-stubble not yet cleared.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He thrust aside the privet boughs and peered.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The drooping fir trees let their darkness trail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Black like a pirate’s masts bound under easy sail.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_45" id="page_45">{45}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The garden with its autumn flowers was there;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The wren upon the tree-stump carolled cheery-voiced.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He could not see her there. Windows were wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Late wasps were cruising, and the curtains shook.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smoke, like the house’s breathing, floated, sighed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the trembling firs strange ways it took.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still no Mary’s presence blessed his look;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The house was still as if deserted, hushed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faint fragrance hung about it as if herbs were crushed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">When first the berry reddens on the thorn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Memories of her that fragrance brought. Forlorn<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The windows of the kitchen opened wide.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Old Mrs. Occleve talked to one inside.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A smell of cooking filled a gust of smoke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then fragrance once again, for herbs were broke;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Old Occleve roared aloud at his own joke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mary, it seemed, was gone; the loved voice never spoke.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nor could her lover see her from the yew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was not there at table; she was ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ill, or away perhaps&mdash;he wished he knew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Away, perhaps, for Occleve bellowed still.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“If sick,” he thought, “the maid or Lion will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take food to her.” He watched; the dinner ended.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The staircase was not used; none climbed it, none descended.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_48" id="page_48">{48}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Not here,” he thought; but wishing to be sure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He waited till the Occleves went to field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then followed, round the house, another lure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Using the well-known privet as his shield.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He meant to run a risk; his heart was steeled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knew of old which bedroom would be hers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He crouched upon the north front in among the firs.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The house stared at him with its red-brick blank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its vacant window-eyes; its open door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With old wrought bridle ring-hooks at each flank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swayed on a creaking hinge as the wind bore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing had changed; the house was as before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dull red brick, the windows sealed or wide:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I will go in,” he said. He rose and stepped inside.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">None could have seen him coming; all was still;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He listened in the doorway for a sign.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above, a rafter creaked, a stir, a thrill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moved, till the frames clacked on the picture line.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Old Mother Occleve sleeps, the servants dine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_49" id="page_49">{49}</a></span>”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He muttered, listening. “Hush.” A silence brooded.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far off the kitchen dinner clattered; he intruded.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Still, to his right, the best room door was locked.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another door was at his left; he stayed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within, a stately timepiece ticked and tocked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To one who slumbered breathing deep; it made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An image of Time’s going and man’s trade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He looked: Old Mother Occleve lay asleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hands crossed upon her knitting, rosy, breathing deep.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He tiptoed up the stairs which creaked and cracked.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The landing creaked; the shut doors, painted gray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loomed, as if shutting in some dreadful act.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nodding frames seemed ready to betray.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The east room had been closed in Michael’s day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being the best; but now he guessed it hers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fields of daffodils lay next it, past the firs.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Just as he reached the landing, Lion cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Somewhere below, “I’ll get it.” Lion’s feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struck on the flagstones with a hasty stride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“He’s coming up,” thought Michael, “we shall meet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_50" id="page_50">{50}</a></span>”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He snatched the nearest door for his retreat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Opened with thieves’ swift silence, dared not close,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But stood within, behind it. Lion’s footsteps rose,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Running two steps at once, while Michael stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not breathing, only knowing that the room<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was someone’s bedroom smelling of old wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hung with engravings of the day of doom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The footsteps stopped; and Lion called, to whom?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A gentle question, tapping at a door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Michael shifted feet, and creakings took the floor.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The footsteps recommenced, a door-catch clacked;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within an eastern room the footsteps passed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drawers were pulled loudly open and ransacked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chattels were thrust aside and overcast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What could the thing be that he sought? At last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His voice said, “Here it is.” The wormèd floor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Creaked with returning footsteps down the corridor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_51" id="page_51">{51}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The footsteps came as though the walker read,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or added rows of figures by the way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was much hesitation in the tread;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lion seemed pondering which, to go or stay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, seeing the door, which covered Michael, sway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He swiftly crossed and shut it. “Always one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For order,” Michael muttered; “Now be swift, my son.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The action seemed to break the walker’s mood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The footsteps passed downstairs, along the hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out at the door and off towards the wood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Gone,” Michael muttered. “Now to hazard all.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Outside, the frames still nodded on the wall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Michael stepped swiftly up the floor to try<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The door where Lion tapped and waited for reply.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It was the eastmost of the rooms which look<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the fields of daffodils; the bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scanned from its windows is Ryemeadows brook,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Banked by gnarled apple trees and rising ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most gently Michael tapped; he heard no sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only the blind-pull tapping with the wind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The kitchen-door was opened; kitchen-clatter dinned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_52" id="page_52">{52}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A woman walked along the hall below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Humming; a maid, he judged; the footsteps died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listening intently still, he heard them go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then swiftly turned the knob and went inside.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blind-pull at the window volleyed wide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The curtains streamed out like a waterfall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pictures of the fox-hunt clacked along the wall.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No one was there; no one; the room was hers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A book of praise lay open on the bed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clothes-press smelt of many lavenders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her spirit stamped the room; herself was fled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here she found peace of soul like daily bread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, with her lover Lion; Michael gazed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would have been the sharer had he not been crazed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He took the love-gift handkerchief again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He laid it on her table, near the glass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So opened that the broidered name was plain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Plain,” he exclaimed, “she cannot let it pass.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It stands and speaks for me as bold as brass.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My answer, my heart’s cry, to tell her this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That she is still my darling; all she was she is.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_53" id="page_53">{53}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“So she will know at least that she was wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That underneath the blindness I was true.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fate is the strongest thing, though men are strong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out from beyond life I was sealed to you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But my blind ways destroyed the cords that drew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now, the evil done, I know my need;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fate has his way with those who mar what is decreed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“And now, good-bye.” He closed the door behind him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then stept, with firm swift footstep down the stair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meaning to go where she would never find him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would go down through darkness to despair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out at the door he stept; the autumn air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came fresh upon his face; none saw him go.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Good-bye, my love,” he muttered; “it is better so.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Soon he was on the high road, out of sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of valley and farm; soon he could see no more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The oast-house pointing finger take the light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As tumbling pigeons glittered over; nor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could he behold the wind-vane gilded o’er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swinging above the church; the road swung round.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Now, the last look,” he cried: he saw that holy ground.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_54" id="page_54">{54}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Good-bye,” he cried; he could behold it all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spread out as in a picture; but so clear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the gold apple stood out from the wall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a red jewel stood the grazing steer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Precise, intensely coloured, all brought near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in a vision, lay that holy ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Mary is there,” he moaned, “and I am outward bound.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I never saw this place so beautiful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never like this. I never saw it glow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spirit is on this place; it fills it full.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So let the die be cast; I will not go.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I will see her face to face and know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From her own lips what thoughts she has of me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if disaster come: right; let disaster be.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Back, by another way, he turned. The sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fired the yew-tops in the Roman woods.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lights in the valley twinkled one by one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The starlings whirled in dropping multitudes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dusk fingered into one earth’s many moods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back to The Roughs he walked; he neared the brook;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lamp burned in the farm; he saw; his fingers shook.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He had to cross the brook, to cross a field<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where daffodils were thick when years were young.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_55" id="page_55">{55}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, were she there, his fortunes should be sealed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down the mud trackway to the brook he swung;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then while the passion trembled on his tongue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dim, by the dim bridge-stile, he seemed to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A figure standing mute; a woman&mdash;it was she.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She stood quite stilly, waiting for him there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She did not seem surprised; the meeting seemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Planned from all time by powers in the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To change their human fates; he even deemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in another life this thing had gleamed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This meeting by the bridge. He said, “It’s you.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Yes, I,” she said, “who else? You must have known; you knew<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“That I should come here to the brook to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After your message.” “You were out,” he said.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Gone, and I did not know where you could be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where were you, Mary, when the thing was laid?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Old Mrs. Cale is dying, and I stayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Longer than usual, while I read the Word.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You could have hardly gone.” She paused, her bosom stirred.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_56" id="page_56">{56}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Mary, I sinned,” he said. “Not that, dear, no,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said; “but, oh, you were unkind, unkind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never to write a word and leave me so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But out of sight with you is out of mind.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Mary, I sinned,” he said, “and I was blind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, my beloved, are you Lion’s wife?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Belov’d sounds strange,” she answered, “in my present life.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“But it is sweet to hear it, all the same.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is a language little heard by me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone, in that man’s keeping, with my shame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I never thought such miseries could be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I was so happy in you, Michael. He<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came when I felt you changed from what I thought you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even now it is not love, but jealousy that brought you.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“That is untrue,” he said. “I am in hell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You are my heart’s beloved, Mary, you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By God, I know your beauty now too well.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We are each other’s, flesh and soul, we two.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“That was sweet knowledge once,” she said; “we knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That truth of old. Now, in a strange man’s bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I read it in my soul, and find it written red.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_57" id="page_57">{57}</a></span>”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Is he a brute?” he asked. “No,” she replied.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I did not understand what it would mean.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now that you are back, would I had died;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Died, and the misery of it not have been.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lion would not be wrecked, nor I unclean.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I was a proud one once, and now I’m tame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, Michael, say some word to take away my shame.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She sobbed; his arms went round her; the night heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Intense fierce whispering passing, soul to soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love running hot on many a murmured word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love’s passionate giving into new control.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their present misery did but blow the coal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did but entangle deeper their two wills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the brown brook ran on by buried daffodils.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Lion lay still while the cold tides of death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came brimming up his channels. With one hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He groped to know if Michael still drew breath.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His little hour was running out its sand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, in a mist, he saw his Mary stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above. He cried aloud, “He was my brother.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And Mary knelt and murmured passionate words<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Far down the stream men pointed where she rode,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Rode the great trackway to the sea, dim, dim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already gone before the stars were gone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw her at the sea-line’s smoky rim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grow swiftly vaguer as they towed her on.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Soon even her masts were hidden in the haze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the city; she was on her course<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To trample billows for a hundred days;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That afternoon the norther gathered force,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Blowing a small snow from a point of east.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Oh, fair for her,” we said, “to take her south.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in our spirits, as the wind increased,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We saw her there, beyond the river mouth,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Setting her side-lights in the wildering dark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To glint upon mad water, while the gale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roared like a battle, snapping like a shark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drunken seamen struggled with the sail.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">While with sick hearts her mates put out of mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their little children left astern, ashore,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Water and air one intermingled roar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_79" id="page_79">{79}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then we forgot her, for the fiddlers played,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The old ship moaned a little as she swayed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It blew all night, oh, bitter hard it blew!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So that at midnight I was called on deck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To keep an anchor-watch: I heard the sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roar past in white procession filled with wreck;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Intense bright frosty stars burned over me,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the Greek brig beside us dipped and dipped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White to the muzzle like a half-tide rock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drowned to the mainmast with the seas she shipped;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her cable-swivels clanged at every shock.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And like a never-dying force, the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roared till we shouted with it, roared until<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its vast vitality of wrath was thinned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had beat its fury breathless and was still.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">By dawn the gale had dwindled into flaw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A glorious morning followed: with my friend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I climbed the fo’c’s’le-head to see; we saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The waters hurrying shorewards without end.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Haze blotted out the river’s lowest reach;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the gloom the steamers, passing by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Called with their sirens, hooting their sea-speech;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the dimness others made reply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_80" id="page_80">{80}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And as we watched, there came a rush of feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Charging the fo’c’s’le till the hatchway shook.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men all about us thrust their way, or beat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crying, “The <i>Wanderer</i>! Down the river! Look!”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I looked with them towards the dimness; there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gleamed like a spirit striding out of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A full-rigged ship unutterably fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her masts like trees in winter, frosty-bright.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Foam trembled at her bows like wisps of wool;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She trembled as she towed. I had not dreamed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That work of man could be so beautiful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In its own presence and in what it seemed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“So, she is putting back again,” I said.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“How white with frost her yards are on the fore.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One of the men about me answer made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“That is not frost, but all her sails are tore,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Torn into tatters, youngster, in the gale;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her best foul-weather suit gone.” It was true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her masts were white with rags of tattered sail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many as gannets when the fish are due.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Beauty in desolation was her pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her crowned array a glory that had been;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She faltered tow’rds us like a swan that died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But although ruined she was still a queen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_81" id="page_81">{81}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Put back with all her sails gone,” went the word;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, from her signals flying, rumour ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“The sea that stove her boats in killed her third;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She has been gutted and has lost a man.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So, as though stepping to a funeral march,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She passed defeated homewards whence she came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ragged with tattered canvas white as starch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wild bird that misfortune had made tame.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She was refitted soon: another took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dead man’s office; then the singers hove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her capstan till the snapping hawsers shook;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out, with a bubble at her bows, she drove.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Again they towed her seawards, and again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We, watching, praised her beauty, praised her trim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw her fair house-flag flutter at the main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And slowly saunter seawards, dwindling dim;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And wished her well, and wondered, as she died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How, when her canvas had been sheeted home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her quivering length would sweep into her stride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making the greenness milky with her foam.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_82" id="page_82">{82}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But when we rose next morning, we discerned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her beauty once again a shattered thing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Towing to dock the <i>Wanderer</i> returned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wounded sea-bird with a broken wing.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A spar was gone, her rigging’s disarray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Told of a worst disaster than the last;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like draggled hair dishevelled hung the stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drooping and beating on the broken mast.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Half-mast upon her flagstaff hung her flag;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Word went among us how the broken spar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had gored her captain like an angry stag,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And killed her mate a half-day from the bar.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She passed to dock upon the top of flood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An old man near me shook his head and swore:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Like a bad woman, she has tasted blood&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There’ll be no trusting in her any more.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We thought it truth, and when we saw her there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lying in dock, beyond, across the stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We would forget that we had called her fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We thought her murderess and the past a dream.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And when she sailed again, we watched in awe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wondering what bloody act her beauty planned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What evil lurked behind the thing we saw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What strength was there that thus annulled man’s hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_83" id="page_83">{83}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How next its triumph would compel man’s will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into compliance with external Fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How next the powers would use her to work ill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On suffering men; we had not long to wait.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For soon the outcry of derision rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Here comes the <i>Wanderer</i>!” the expected cry.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Guessing the cause, our mockings joined with those<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yelled from the shipping as they towed her by.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She passed us close, her seamen paid no heed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To what was called: they stood, a sullen group,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smoking and spitting, careless of her need,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mocking the orders given from the poop.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Her mates and boys were working her; we stared.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What was the reason of this strange return,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This third annulling of the thing prepared?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No outward evil could our eyes discern.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Only like someone who has formed a plan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the pitch of common minds, she sailed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mocked and deserted by the common man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made half divine to me for having failed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We learned the reason soon; below the town<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A stay had parted like a snapping reed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Warning,” the men thought, “not to take her down.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They took the omen, they would not proceed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_84" id="page_84">{84}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Days passed before another crew would sign.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The <i>Wanderer</i> lay in dock alone, unmanned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feared as a thing possessed by powers malign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound under curses not to leave the land.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But under passing Time fear passes too;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That terror passed, the sailors’ hearts grew bold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We learned in time that she had found a crew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And was bound out and southwards as of old.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And in contempt we thought, “A little while<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will bring her back again, dismantled, spoiled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is herself; she cannot change her style;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She has the habit now of being foiled.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So when a ship appeared among the haze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We thought, “The <i>Wanderer</i> back again”; but no,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No <i>Wanderer</i> showed for many, many days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her passing lights made other waters glow.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But we would often think and talk of her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell newer hands her story, wondering, then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon what ocean she was <i>Wanderer</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound to the cities built by foreign men.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And one by one our little conclave thinned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passed into ships and sailed and so away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To drown in some great roaring of the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wanderers themselves, unhappy fortune’s prey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_85" id="page_85">{85}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And Time went by me making memory dim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet still I wondered if the <i>Wanderer</i> fared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still pointing to the unreached ocean’s rim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brightening the water where her breast was bared.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And much in ports abroad I eyed the ships,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hoping to see her well-remembered form<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come with a curl of bubbles at her lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright to her berth, the sovereign of the storm.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I never did, and many years went by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, near a Southern port, one Christmas Eve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I watched a gale go roaring through the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making the caldrons of the clouds upheave.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the wrack tattered and the stars appeared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Millions of stars that seemed to speak in fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A byre cock cried aloud that morning neared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The swinging wind-vane flashed upon the spire.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And soon men looked upon a glittering earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Intensely sparkling like a world new-born;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only to look was spiritual birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So bright the raindrops ran along the thorn.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So bright they were, that one could almost pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond their twinkling to the source, and know<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That hidden soul which makes the flowers grow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_86" id="page_86">{86}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That soul was there apparent, not revealed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unearthly meanings covered every tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wet grass grew in an immortal field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those waters fed some never-wrinkled sea.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The scarlet berries in the hedge stood out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like revelations but the tongue unknown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even in the brooks a joy was quick: the trout<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rushed in a dumbness dumb to me alone.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All of the valley was aloud with brooks;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I walked the morning, breasting up the fells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Taking again lost childhood from the rooks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose cawing came above the Christmas bells.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I had not walked that glittering world before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But up the hill a prompting came to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“This line of upland runs along the shore:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the hedgerow I shall see the sea.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And on the instant from beyond away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That long familiar sound, a ship’s bell, broke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hush below me in the unseen bay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old memories came: that inner prompting spoke.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And bright above the hedge a seagull’s wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flashed and were steady upon empty air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“A Power unseen,” I cried, “prepares these things;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Those are her bells, the <i>Wanderer</i> is there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_87" id="page_87">{87}</a></span>”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So, hurrying to the hedge and looking down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw a mighty bay’s wind-crinkled blue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ruffling the image of a tranquil town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With lapsing waters glittering as they grew.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And near me in the road the shipping swung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So stately and so still in such great peace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That like to drooping crests their colours hung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only their shadows trembled without cease.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I did but glance upon those anchored ships.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even as my thought had told, I saw her plain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tense, like a supple athlete with lean hips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swiftness at pause, the <i>Wanderer</i> come again&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Like a man’s thought transfigured into fire.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And as I looked, one of her men began<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sing some simple tune of Christmas Day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among her crew the song spread, man to man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until the singing rang across the bay;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And soon in other anchored ships the men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Joined in the singing with clear throats, until<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The meaning shows in the defeated thing.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">How still this quiet cornfield is to-night!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By an intenser glow the evening falls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bringing, not darkness, but a deeper light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the stooks a partridge covey calls.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The windows glitter on the distant hill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the hedge the sheep-bells in the fold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stumble on sudden music and are still;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The forlorn pinewoods droop above the wold.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">An endless quiet valley reaches out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Past the blue hills into the evening sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the stubble, cawing, goes a rout<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of rooks from harvest, flagging as they fly.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So beautiful it is, I never saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So great a beauty on these English fields,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">These homes, this valley spread below me here,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To unknown generations of dead men,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Who, century after century, held these farms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, looking out to watch the changing sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard, as we hear, the rumours and alarms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of war at hand and danger pressing nigh,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And knew, as we know, that the message meant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The breaking off of ties, the loss of friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death, like a miser getting in his rent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no new stones laid where the trackway ends,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The harvest not yet won, the empty bin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The friendly horses taken from the stalls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fallow on the hill not yet brought in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cracks unplastered in the leaking walls,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet heard the news, and went discouraged home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brooded by the fire with heavy mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With such dumb loving of the Berkshire loam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As breaks the dumb hearts of the English kind,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then sadly rose and left the well-loved Downs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so by ship to sea, and knew no more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fields of home, the byres, the market towns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor the dear outline of the English shore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_90" id="page_90">{90}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But knew the misery of the soaking trench,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The freezing in the rigging, the despair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the revolting second of the wrench<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the blind soul is flung upon the air,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And died (uncouthly, most) in foreign lands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For some idea but dimly understood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of an English city never built by hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which love of England prompted and made good.<br /></span>
<span class="iast">* * * *<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If there be any life beyond the grave,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Some power of quick suggestion how to save,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Touching the living soul as from above,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">An influence from the Earth from those dead hearts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So passionate once, so deep, so truly kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in the living child the spirit starts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feeling companioned still, not left behind.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Surely above these fields a spirit broods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sense of many watchers muttering near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the lone Downland with the forlorn woods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loved to the death, inestimably dear,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A muttering from beyond the veils of Death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From long-dead men, to whom this quiet scene<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came among blinding tears with the last breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dying soldier’s vision of his queen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_91" id="page_91">{91}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All the unspoken worship of those lives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spent in forgotten wars at other calls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glimmers upon these fields where evening drives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beauty like breath, so gently darkness falls,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Darkness that makes the meadows holier still.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The elm-trees sadden in the hedge, a sigh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moves in the beech-clump on the haunted hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rising planets deepen in the sky,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And silence broods like spirit on the brae,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A glimmering moon begins, the moonlight runs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the grasses of the ancient way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rutted this morning by the passing guns.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Those tombstones of dead selves, those hours of birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those moments of the soul in years of earth.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The day on which, beneath an arching sail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw the Cordilleras and gave hail;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The summer day on which in heart’s delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw the Swansea Mumbles bursting white;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glittering day when all the waves wore flags,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the ship <i>Wanderer</i> came with sails in rags;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That curlew-calling time in Irish dusk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When life became more splendid than its husk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the rent chapel on the brae at Slains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone with a doorway opening beyond brains;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dawn when, with a brace-block’s creaking cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the mist a little barque slipped by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spilling the mist with changing gleams of red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then gone, with one raised hand and one turned head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The howling evening when the spindrift’s mists<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broke to display the Four Evangelists,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_93" id="page_93">{93}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Snow-capped, divinely granite, lashed by breakers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wind-beaten bones of long since buried acres;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The night alone near water when I heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the sea’s spirit spoken by a bird;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The English dusk when I beheld once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(With eyes so changed) the ship, the citied shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lines of masts, the streets so cheerly trod<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(In happier seasons), and gave thanks to God.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All had their beauty, their bright moments’ gift,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their something caught from Time, the ever-swift.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All of those gleams were golden; but life’s hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have given more constant gifts in changing lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when I count those gifts, I think them such<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As no man’s bounty could have bettered much:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gift of country life, near hills and woods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where happy waters sing in solitudes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gift of being near ships, of seeing each day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A city of ships with great ships under weigh;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The great street paved with water, filled with shipping,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the world’s flags flying and seagulls dipping.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet when I am dust my penman may not know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those water-trampling ships which made me glow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_94" id="page_94">{94}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But think my wonder mad and fail to find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their glory, even dimly, from my mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet they made me. Not alone the ships,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But men hard-palmed from tallying-on to whips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The two close friends of nearly twenty years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sea-followers both, sea-wrestlers and sea-peers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose feet with mine wore many a bolthead bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Treading the decks beneath the riding light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet death will make that warmth of friendship cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And who’ll know what one said and what one told<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our hearts’ communion and the broken spells<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the loud call blew at the strike of bells?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No one, I know, yet let me be believed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A soul entirely known is life achieved.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Years blank with hardship never speak a word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Live in the soul to make the being stirred;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Towns can be prisons, where the spirit dulls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Away from mates and ocean-wandering hulls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Away from all bright water and great hills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sheep-walks, where the curlews cry their fills;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Away in towns, where eyes have nought to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But dead museums and miles of misery,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And floating life unrooted from man’s need,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And miles of fish-hooks baited to catch greed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_95" id="page_95">{95}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And life made wretched out of human ken,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And miles of shopping women served by men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, if the penman sums my London days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him but say that there were holy ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dull Bloomsbury streets of dull brick mansions old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With stinking doors, where women stood to scold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drunken waits at Christmas with their horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Droning the news, in snow, that Christ was born;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And windy gas-lamps and the wet roads shining,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that old carol of the midnight whining,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that old room (above the noisy slum),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where there was wine and fire and talk with some<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under strange pictures of the wakened soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To whom this earth was but a burnt-out coal.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O Time, bring back those midnights and those friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those glittering moments that a spirit lends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all may be imagined from the flash,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cloud-hid god-game through the lightning gash,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those hours of stricken sparks from which men took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Light to send out to men in song or book.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_96" id="page_96">{96}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Those friends who heard St. Pancras’s bells strike two<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet stayed until the barber’s cockerel crew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Talking of noble styles, the Frenchman’s best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thought beyond great poets not expressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glory of mood where human frailty failed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The forts of human light not yet assailed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the dim room had mind, and seemed to brood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Binding our wills to mental brotherhood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till we became a college, and each night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was discipline and manhood and delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till our farewells, and winding down the stairs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At each grey dawn had meaning that Time spares,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That we, so linked, should roam the whole world round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Teaching the ways our brooding minds had found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making that room our Chapter, our one mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where all that this world soiled should be refined.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Often at night I tread those streets again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And see the alley glimmering in the rain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet now I miss that sign of earlier tramps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A house with shadows of plane-boughs under lamps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_97" id="page_97">{97}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The secret house where once a beggar stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trembling and blind to show his woe for food.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now I miss that friend who used to walk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Home to my lodgings with me, deep in talk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wearing the last of night out in still streets<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trodden by us and policemen on their beats<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cats, but else deserted. Now I miss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lively mind and guttural laugh of his,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that strange way he had of making gleam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like something real, the art we used to dream.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">London has been my prison; but my books,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hills and great waters, labouring men and brooks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ships and deep friendships, and remembered days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which even now set all my mind ablaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As that June day when, in the red bricks’ chinks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw the old Roman ruins white with pinks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And felt the hillside haunted even then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By not dead memory of the Roman men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And felt the hillside thronged by souls unseen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who knew the interest in me, and were keen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That man alive should understand man dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So many centuries since the blood was shed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quickened with strange hush because this comer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Felt a strange soul alive behind the summer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_98" id="page_98">{98}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That other day on Ercall when the stones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were sunbleached white, like long unburied bones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the bees droned and all the air was sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From honey buried underneath my feet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Honey of purple heather and white clover<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sealed in its gummy bags till summer’s over.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then other days by water, by bright sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clear as clean glass and my bright friend with me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cove clean bottomed where we saw the brown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Red spotted plaice go skimming six feet down<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Waving, unfolding, drooping, to the swells;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sadder day when we beheld the great<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Headlong, tree-tumbling fury of collapse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While drenching clouds drove by and every sense<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where torn white hair of torrents shook and streamed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sadder day when we beheld again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A spate going down in sunshine after rain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_99" id="page_99">{99}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the blue reach of water leaping bright<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the curse quickened from the cox, our bows<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Chastity vows and temperance; in our pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We numbered things we’d never eat again<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A wild-duck, likely, at Sars Holt Pond,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sheep on the Sars Holt Down beyond.<br /></span>
<span class="iast">* * * *<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The leeward smells were much less certain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the Ghost Heath Hill was like a curtain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet vague, from the leeward, now and then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came muffled sounds like the sound of men.<br /></span>
<span class="iast">* * * *<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He moved to his right to a clearer space,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As over the hill a murmur rose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_143" id="page_143">{143}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His ears were cocked and his keen nose flaired,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sneered with his lips till his teeth were bared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He trotted right and lifted a pad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trying to test what foes he had.<br /></span>
<span class="iast">* * * *<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Ghost Heath turf was a steady drumming<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which sounded like horses quickly coming,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It died as the hunt went down the dip,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Malapert yelped at Myngs’s whip.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bright iron horseshoe clinkt on stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then a man’s voice spoke, not one alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then a burst of laughter, swiftly still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Muffled away by Ghost Heath Hill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, indistinctly, the clop, clip, clep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Brady Ride, of a horse’s step.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then silence, then, in a burst, much clearer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Voices and horses coming nearer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And another noise, of a pit-pat beat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the Ghost Hill grass, of foxhound feet.<br /></span>
<span class="iast">* * * *<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sat on his haunches listening hard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While his mind went over the compass card.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men were coming and rest was done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he still had time to get fit to run;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He could outlast horse and outrace hound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But men were devils from Lobs’s Pound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scent was burning, the going good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world one lust for a fox’s blood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_144" id="page_144">{144}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The main earths stopped and the drains put to,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But of all the ills, the ill least pleasant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was to run in the light when men were present<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men in the fields to shout and sign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a lift of hounds to a fox’s line.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men at the earth, at the long point’s end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men at each check and none his friend,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But still, needs must when the devil drives.<br /></span>
<span class="iast">* * * *<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He readied himself, then a soft horn blew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then a clear voice carolled, “Ed-hoick! Eleu!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the wood-end rang with the clear voice crying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the crackle of scrub where hounds were trying.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the horn blew nearer, a hound’s voice quivered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then another, then more, till his body shivered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He left his kennel and trotted thence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his ears flexed back and his nerves all tense.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Danger was coming, so swift, so swift,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And all these devils, how find a path?<br /></span>
<span class="iast">* * * *<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He ran like a stag to the wood’s north corner,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the hedge was thick and the ditch a yawner,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the scarlet glimpse of Myngs on Turk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watching the woodside, made him shirk.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Was Dansey, still as a stone, on picket.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A crying that stiffened the hair on skin,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Lark’s Leybourne Copse is the line he’ll take.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And men moved up with their talk and stink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the traplike noise of the horseshoe clink.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men whose coming meant death from teeth<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The blue dog-violets grew there, and many primroses.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Out of the wood I wandered, but paused upon the heath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To watch, beyond the tree-tops, the wrinkled sea beneath;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Smelling of bruisèd spice and burning amber.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There slaves were sent to fetch the newly risen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Servants and warders of the woman’s prison.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Those crones again, I doubt not they were whipt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For letting us escape them while they slept.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">If we had killed his son it had been less.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then gather all the slaves, and flay these three<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He stood behind a chair, and bent and muttered;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grand still, grey, sunburnt, bright with mad eyes brown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burning, though dying, like a torch that guttered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That once had lit Queen Helen through the town.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I only saw him once: I saw him go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaning uphill his body to the rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too good a man for life to punish so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Theirs were the pride and passion, his the pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His old coat flapped; the little children turned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see him pass, that passionate age that burned.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I knew them well, all three,” the old man said;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“He was an unused force, and she a child.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He would not work with others, could not rest,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yet here he stayed, with devils in his breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To blast the woman who had dared to cage him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, when the scholar came, it made the three:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She turned to him, and he, he turned to her.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They both were saints: elopement could not be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So here they stayed, and passion plied the spur.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the men fought, and later she was found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that green pool beyond the headland, drowned.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“They carried her drowned body up the grass<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The scholar begged to see her, being dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The husband walked downstairs, to see him there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Begging to see her as one asks an alms.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spat at him and cut his cheek-bone bare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘There’s pay,’ he said, ‘my poet, for your psalms.’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then they fought together at the door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Biting each other, like two dogs, while she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay dead, poor woman, dripping on the floor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of her hair the death-drops of the sea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_190" id="page_190">{190}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Later, they fought whenever they might meet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In church, or in the fields, or in the street.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Up on the hill another aged man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remembered them. He said: “They were afraid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They feared to end the passions they began.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They held the cards, and yet they never played.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He should have broken from her at all cost;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She should have loved her lover and gone free.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They all held winning cards, and yet they lost;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So two were wrecked and one drowned in the sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some harshness or some law, or else some fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stifled their souls; God help us! when we know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Certainly, certain things, the way is clear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet they paid, and one respects them so.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps they were too fine. I know not, I.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men must have mercy, being ripe to die.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So this old house of mourning was the stage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(This house and those green fields) for all that woe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are her books, her writing on the page;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In those choked beds she made the flowers grow.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And in this house the wind goes whining wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The door blows open, till I think to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That delicate sweet woman, like a child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Standing with great dark stag’s eyes watching me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watching as though her sorrow might make plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Had I but wit) the meaning of such pain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I wonder if she sang in this old room.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, never! No; they tell me that she stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For hours together staring into gloom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the prison bars of flesh and blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, when the ninth wave drowned her, haply she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wakened, with merging senses, till she blent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the joy and colour of the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One with the purpose of the element.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there, perhaps, she cannot feel the woe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passed in this rotting house, but runs like light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the billows where the clippers go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One with the blue sea’s pureness of delight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laughing, perhaps, at that old woe of hers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chained in the cage with fellow-prisoners.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He died in that lone cottage near the sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the grey morning when the tide was turning,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From cares of meat and dress, from joys and yearning.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then like an old man gathering strength, he strayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the beach, and strength came into him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beauty that never threatened nor betrayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made bright the eyes that sorrow had made dim;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that upon that stretch of barren sand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knew his dreams; he saw her beauty run<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Sorrowful Beauty, laughing, hand in hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He heard the trumpets blow in Avalon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw the golden statue stretching down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wreath, for him, of roses, in a crown.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They say that as her husband lay a-dying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He clamoured for a chain to beat the hound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They say that all the garden rang with crying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That came out of the air, out of the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the waste that was his soul, may be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the running wolf-hound of his soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That had been kennelled in and now broke free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out to the moors where stags go, past control.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All through his life his will had kennelled him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now he was free, and with a hackling fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He snarled out of the body to the dim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To run the spirits with the hounds of hell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To run forever at the quarry gone,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And soul the stag escaped the hound desire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now, perhaps, the memory of their hate<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now they closed on their leaders, and the running increased,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They rushed down the arc curving round to the east;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the air rang with roaring, all the peopled loud stands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roared aloud from tense faces, shook with hats and waved hands.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So they cleared the green gorse-bush by bursting it through,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was no time for thinking, there was scarce time to do.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Charles gritted his spirit as he charged through the gorse:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“You must just grin and suffer: sit still on your horse.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There in front was a hurdle and the Distance Post white,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Sir Lopez! Sir Lopez!” then the jigging brass laughter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the yellow toss’t swing-boats swooping rafter to rafter.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the blare of all organs, then the roar of all throats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they shot past the side shows, the horses and boats.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now the Wants of the Watchers whirled into the race<br /></span>

<span class="i0">They fought with those horses or helped them to strive.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Like leaves blown on Hudson when maples turn gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They whirled in their colour, they clutched to catch hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They sang to the riders, they smote at their hearts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like flakes of live fire, like castings of darts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_199" id="page_199">{199}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As a snow in Wisconsin when the darkness comes down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Running white on the prairie, making all the air brown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blinding men with the hurry of its millions of feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So the Wants pelted on them, so they blinded and beat.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And like spirits calm shining upon horses of flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came the Friends of those riders to shield them from shame,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Singing songs of the glory of the world without end;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And as men in Wisconsin driving cars in the snow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Butt against its impulsion and face to the blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tossing snow from their bonnets as a ship tosses foam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So the Friends tossed the Wantings as they brought their friends home.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now they charged the last hurdle that led to the Straight,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He came to his horses as they came to the leap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eight hard-driven horses, eight men breathing deep.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On the left, as he leaped it, a flashing of brown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kicking white on the grass, showed that Thankful was down;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then a glance, right and left, showed that, barring all flukes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was Soyland’s, Sir Lopez’, or Peterkinooks’.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He passed the Red Ember, he came to the flank<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There were only two others, going level alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First the spotted cream jacket, then the blue, white and roan.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Up the street of green race-course they strained for the prize,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">“Now, Sir Lopez!” “Come, Soyland!” “Now, Sir Lopez! Now, now!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Charles judged his second, but he could not tell how.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But a glory of sureness leaped from horse into man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the man said, “Now, beauty,” and the horse said, “I can.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_201" id="page_201">{201}</a></span>”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the long weary Royal made an effort the more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though his heart thumped like drum-beats as he went to the fore.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Neck and neck went Sir Lopez and Soyland together,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soyland first, a short head, with his neck all in lather;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both were ridden their hardest, both were doing their best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Right Royal reached Soyland and came to his chest.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There Soyland’s man saw him with the heel of his eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A horse with an effort that could beat him or tie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he glanced at Sir Lopez, and he bit through his lip,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he drove in his spurs and he took up his whip.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There he lashed the game Soyland who had given his all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he gave three strides more, and then failed at the call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he dropped behind Royal like a leaf in a tide:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Sir Lopez and Royal ran on side by side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_202" id="page_202">{202}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There they looked at each other, and they rode, and were grim;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Charles thought, “That’s Sir Lopez. I shall never beat him.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the yells for Sir Lopez seemed to darken the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They were rushing past Emmy and the White Post was there.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He drew to Sir Lopez; but Sir Lopez drew clear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Right Royal clung to him and crept to his ear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the man on Sir Lopez judged the moment had come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the last ounce of effort that would bring his horse home.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So he picked up his whip for three swift slashing blows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Sir Lopez drew clear, but Right Royal stuck close,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he gained, past his withers, past his neck to his head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Sir Lopez’ man lashing, Charles still, seeing red.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So they rushed for one second, then Sir Lopez shot out:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Charles thought, “There, he’s done me, without any doubt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_203" id="page_203">{203}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, come now, Right Royal!”<br /></span>
<span class="i7">And Sir Lopez changed feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his ears went back level; Sir Lopez was beat.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Right Royal went past him, half an inch, half a head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half a neck, he was leading, for an instant he led;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With a lightning-like effort from little Gavotte.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The little bright mare, made of nerves and steel springs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shot level beside him, shot ahead as with wings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Charles felt his horse quicken, felt the desperate beat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the blood in his body from his knees to his feet.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Three terrible strides brought him up to the mare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they rushed to wild shouting through a whirl of blow air;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Gavotte died to nothing; Soyland came once again<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then a whirl of urged horses thundered up, whipped and blown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soyland, Peterkinooks, and Red Ember the roan.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For an instant they challenged, then they drooped and were done;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the White Post shot backwards, Right Royal had won.<br /></span>
